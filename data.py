androidOnJava = ['Unfortunately I and a few others have gotten a point in this course where a big issue arises in one of the apps and the instructor no longer responds to questions to aid with this issue','The updated/ newer versions of android studio or other services should be used in the tutorials and possible errors and their solutions should be mentioned in the same.','Overall good course. I would prefer if it was going deeper into Android Studio and Development,but good insight was provided into marketing and launching the app and all the tricks.','I enjoyed the experience of learning both android programming and thinking programmatically from you guys','This course is amazingly immersive and quite all-inclusive from end-to-end to develop an app!']
